### Programming Project

# The idea:

For my programming project I intended to improve upon a stacking classifier that combines the output of different machine learning algorithms to make more accurate predictions. My plan is to package the code in a neater, more self-contained way and improve the documentation. I also want to improve the user interface, so that the model can more easily be applied to generic input data.


# What I did:


* Improved data reading interface of the Stacker module. One function now fulfills all necessary functionality.

* Changed function and variable names to be consistent with PEP8 standard.

* Added numpydoc style docstrings to relevant functions.

* Built html documentation page using Sphinx.

* Integrated Read the docs with my github repo so that my documentation is automatically built whenever the repo is updated. Link to read the docs documentation page: https://aspp2021-vt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

* Made a python package out of my code and uploaded it to testpypi. Link to project on testpypi: https://test.pypi.org/project/stack-classifier-Viktorth93/
