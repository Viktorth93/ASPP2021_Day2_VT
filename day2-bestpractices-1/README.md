# Exercise solutions for day2

Exercise 1: Solutions are found in the directory "animals"

Exercise 2: Bug fixes are implemented in the files in the folder "buggy".

Exercise 3: The results of the profiling of the "matmult.py" script, including answers to the questions, can be found in "Profiling.txt". The same for "euler72.py" can be found in "Profiling_Euler.txt". I first optimized the code using numpy ("matmult_optim.py") and then tried to do it without numpy as well ("matmult_nonnumpyoptim.py").
